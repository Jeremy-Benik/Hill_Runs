# Hill_Runs
Please note, this repository is no longer being maintained/updated. We have brought up this issue to the developers of WRF-SFIRE and changes to the code are being implemented. I will still go through and organize/comment everything, but no files will be added to this (1/18/2023)
My codes from the hill runs so I can verify the rate of spread of the fire with different adjr0 coefficients.
